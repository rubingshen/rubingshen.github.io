# Welcome!


I am a PhD candidate in sociology at the [Sciences Po's Médialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) and at the [CREST (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)](https://crest.science), under the supervision of [Jean-Philippe Cointet](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/people/jean-philippe-cointet/) and [Étienne Ollion](https://ollion.cnrs.fr/english/). 



My research focuses on the transformations of political journalism in France over the last decades, with a special focus on the changing framing of politics-related events in French print media. By combining machine learning (especially *natural language processing*) and econometric methods, I aim to identify the driving forces accounting for changes in journalistic norms. 



I also have a methodological interest in computational social sciences. Based on examples from my empirical research, I attempt to illustrate how machine learning can provide new insights into some classic research questions in social sciences.
