# Welcome!


I am a PhD candidate in sociology at the [Sciences Po's Médialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) and at the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics](https://crest.science), under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Cointet and Étienne Ollion. 



My research focuses on the transformations of political journalism in France over the last decades, with a special focus on the changing narrative of politics-related events in French print media. By combining machine learning (especially *natural language processing*) and econometric methods, I aim to identify the driving forces accounting for changes in journalistic norms. 



I also have a methodological interest in computational social sciences. Based on examples from my empirical research, I attempt to illustrate how machine learning methods can provide new insights into some classical research questions in social sciences. 



## Research Interests
- Sociology of Journalism. Cultural Sociology. Computational Social Sciences. Natural Language Processing. Causal Inference.
